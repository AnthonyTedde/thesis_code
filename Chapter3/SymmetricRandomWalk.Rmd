The symetric random walk will be described in this document (Mt).

At a certain time t the random walk could take two different value:

 * 1 with probability $0$
 * 0 with probability $1 - p$
 
So first of all the probability measure $p$ has to be defined:
```{r echo=TRUE}
p <- 1/2
q <- 1 - p
```

Furthermore the period of measurement of the SRW has to be specified. I decide to examine the SRW accross a 300 steps period.
```{r echo=TRUE}
 size <- 300
```

# Construction of the Symetric Random Walk

The first step consist on creating a zero squared matrix with size: $(size + 1) \times (size + 1)$:
  
\left[ {\begin{array}{ccccc}
```{r}
Mt <- data.frame(matrix(rep(0, (size + 1)^2), nrow = size + 1))
l <- 300
k <- 200
```
